# ableplayer-light
This is a lightweight version of the [Able Player](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer) repo. It contains the latest release of Able Player (from the master branch), but excludes all demo files in order to attain a more manageable download size.

For complete documentation see the main repo or the [Able Player project page](https://ableplayer.github.io/ableplayer).  

## Building

When running the Ableplayer build process, the files will be named
`ableplayer-light.*` by default. If you want to build files as `ableplayer.*`,
run Grunt as follows:

`grunt --packagename=ableplayer`
